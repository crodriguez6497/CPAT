Welcome to the Crane POAM Automation Tool's (CPAT) documentation!
===================================

**C-PAT** is an Open Source API and Web client designed to streamline the POAM process through tailored integrations and effective data mapping, effectively providing more granular oversight throughout the vulnerability lifecycle and shortening the timeframe from detection to remediation.



It pulls data from the `Open Food Facts database <https://world.openfoodfacts.org/>`_
and offers a *simple* and *intuitive* API.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.

  What is a POAM?
  --------
  'NIST <https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/POAM>' defines a POAM as "a document for a system that identifies tasks needing to be accomplished.  It details resources required to accomplish the elements of the plan, any milestones in meetings the tasks, and scheduled completion dates for the milestones".   

  The POAM document is an output of the "Assess" step of the Risk Management Framework.
